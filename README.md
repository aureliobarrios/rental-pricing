## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to build a simple Linear Regression Model with the intent to predict price of housing properties. This project begins by exploring and cleaning our housing dataset with intent to prepare the dataset for Machine Learning Model building. The project can be useful for companies interested in analyzing the housing market and building a model that can help give a better idea of their unit pricing.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to analyze our in-house dataset of various rental properties from Taipei City, Taiwan in order to build a Machine Learning model that can be used in the future to output property rental pricing based on past trends. The project begins with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of our dataset which provides plenty of insights. Using boxplots, scatterplots and histograms we analyze the relationships between our features and our target variables. After careful EDA we move on to data cleaning in order to prepare our dataset for our Linear Regression model. We remove outlier values and rows with missing values in order for our model to better capture the relationship between our features and target variable. The project ends with our Linear Regression model that can know output a rental price estimate based on our previous stored data.
